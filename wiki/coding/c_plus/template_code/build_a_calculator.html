        <article>
                <p style="font-size: 22px;">
                From the very beginning history of technology, we have known many machines that have been invented by scientists. One of the earliest computing machines was a calculator that was invented for the simple sum, add, multiply and divide calculations. That was a huge big machine compared to the current calculator gadget that is quite little and portable. But, different programming languages provide us with the opportunity to do more mathematical calculations like calculators within programs without a calculator. So, In this guide, we will be showing you the programs to create a calculator in the C++ platform of the Ubuntu 20.04 system.
                </p>

                <h4>Example 01:</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 22px;">
                So, let’s start the first example with the terminal shell opening using the shortcut key, i.e., “Ctrl+Alt+T”. You need to have a c++ file in which you will do your c++ coding. We are creating it within the shell console using the “touch” query of the Ubuntu 20.04 system. The file name is “calculator.cc”. This file can be accessed from the “home” directory and can be opened in any of the editors provided by Ubuntu 20.04. Therefore, we have used the “GNU Nano” editor of Ubuntu 20.04 that comes built-in in it. Both the commands are shown in the appended image.</p>
             
                <pre>
touch calculator.cc
vim calculator.cc
                </pre>
        </article>
        <article>
                <p style="font-size: 22px;">The program is started from the “iostream” header file inclusion and standard “std” namespace. This program will only perform 4 basic calculator operations, i.e., sum, subtract, multiply, and divide. A main() function is started with the declaration of two float variables v1 and v2, and one character type variable, “sign”.The first “cout” clause asks the user to add the operator sign in the terminal and save it to the variable “sign” using the “cin” clause. The other cout statement asks the user to add two float values and save them to the variables v1 and v2 consecutively using the “cin” statement. We have utilized the “switch” statement to perform the calculator operations.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 22px;">
                The “switch” statement uses the “sign” variable as a switch value. According to this “sign” variable value, the switch cases will get executed. If the user pressed “+” on asking for an operator, it will execute the “+” case and add the values of v1 and v2 variables and display them on the shell. If the user adds the “-“ sign upon asking, it will execute the “-“ case and subtract the v2 value from the v1 value. If the user adds the “*” sign, it will execute the “*” case and multiply v1 with v2. The “/” case will be executed if the user adds the “/” sign upon asking, and the variable v1 value will be divided by value v2. The default case will be executed if the user added anything other than the “+,-,/,*” sign upon asking the operator “sign”. This was all about the calculator creation in the C++ program. Let’s just save it with “Ctrl+S” and quit the editor to get back to the terminal
