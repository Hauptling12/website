        <h1>How To Fix Busybox Initramfs Error</h1>
        <h2>Solve Busybox Initramfs error</h2>
        <p>
        This brief guide explains how to <strong>fix Busybox Initramfs error on Ubuntu Linux</strong>. I use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as my daily driver on my Dell Inspiron laptop. Today I turned it on and the boot process dropped to the BusyBox shell and I ended up at the <code>initramfs</code> prompt.
        </p>
        <p>
        As far as I can remember, I did nothing wrong. I didn't forcibly power off it. It was working just fine yesterday! When I switched it on today, I landed in the BusyBox shell:
        </p>
        <pre style="background-color:darkgrey">
BusyBox v1.30.1 (Ubuntu 1:1.30.1-4ubuntu6.1) built-in shell (ash) 
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

(initramfs)
        </pre>
        <p>
        I can't get past this screen. Also it doesn't show what exactly the problem is. All I see is just a blank busybox shell.
        </p>
        <p>
        I wasn't sure what to do at this point. So I simply passed the <code>exit</code> command to see what happens.
        </p>
        <p>
        And then I saw the actual error:
        </p>
        <pre style="background-color:darkgrey">
        (initramfs) exit

        As you can see in the above output, the <code>/dev/sda1</code> partition is corrupted. The file system in this partition has some errors. If you ever encountered with this type of problem, you need to check and repair the problematic Linux filesystems with <code>fsck</code> command.
        </p>
        <p>
        Please note that sometimes you don't see any errors after typing the <code>exit</code> command. In that case, try to run <code>fsck</code> on all filesystems.
        </p>
        <pre style="background:darkgrey">

For those wondering, <strong>Busybox</strong> is software suite that provides many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Initramfs</strong> is an initial ram file system based on <code>tmpfs</code>. It contains the tools and scripts required to mount the file systems before the init binary on the real root file system is called.

        </pre>
        <h1>Fix Busybox Initramfs Error On Ubuntu Linux</h1>
        <p>
        1. To solve <code>initramfs</code> error on Ubuntu Linux, you need to repair the filesystem in the corrupted partition using <code>fsck</code> command like below:
        </p>
        <pre style="background-color:darkgrey">
        (initramfs) fsck /dev/sda1 -y
        </pre>
        <p>
        Replace <code>/dev/sda1</code> with your partition name. In your system, it could be <code>/dev/sdb1</code>, <code>/dev/sdc1</code> etc. You can use <code>cat /proc/partitions</code> or <code>blkid</code> commands to get your Linux partition details in Busybox.
        </p>
        <p>
        2. Now the <code>fsck</code> command will start to fix all bad blocks automatically in the filesystem.
        </p>
        <p>
        After a couple minutes, you will see an output like below:
        </p>
        <pre>
        /dev/sda1: ***** FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED *****
/dev/sda1: 497733/30531584 files (1.5% non-contiguous), ........
        </pre>
        <p>
        3. Next, type <code>reboot</code> and hit <code>ENTER</code> to restart your system!
        </p>
        <pre>
        (initramfs) reboot
        </pre>
        <center>

        </center>
        <p>
        If the reboot command doesn't work, type exit and hit ENTER.
        </p>
        <p>
        Cross your fingers and wait for the system to reboot! If all went well, your system will boot normally without any problem.
        </p>
        <p>
        These steps helped me and many others (see the comment section below) to solve Busybox Initramfs error on Ubuntu Linux operating system. If you are stuck in initramfs prompt, this guide will definitely help.

<p><span style="color;red">Heads Up:</span>If you keep getting this error often, probably your hard disk is getting weaker. In that case, it is recommended to backup the data and replace the hard disk as soon as possible.</p>
